# Code Review for 0003_auto_20250725_0037.py

This code is a Django migration file. Django uses migrations to track and apply changes to your database schema. Let's break it down line by line:

*   **`# Generated by Django 3.2.25 on 2025-07-25 05:37`**:  This is a comment indicating when and how this migration file was automatically generated by Django. It tells us it was created using Django version 3.2.25 on July 25, 2025, at 05:37.  This is for informational purposes.

*   **`from django.db import migrations, models`**: This line imports necessary modules from the Django framework:
    *   `migrations`:  This module contains classes and functions for defining and applying database migrations.
    *   `models`: This module provides tools for defining your data models (classes that represent your database tables).

*   **`class Migration(migrations.Migration):`**: This defines a class named `Migration` that inherits from `migrations.Migration`.  This class *is* the migration.

*   **`dependencies = [`**:  This defines a list of dependencies.  These are other migrations that need to be applied *before* this one can be applied.
    *   **`('transacciones', '0002_remove_transaccion_usuario'),`**: This states that this migration depends on the migration named `0002_remove_transaccion_usuario` in the app named `transacciones`. This ensures the changes from that previous migration are already applied to the database before this one is executed.  Specifically, it had already removed the `usuario` field.

*   **`operations = [`**: This defines a list of *operations* to be performed on the database schema. These operations are the core of the migration.
    *   **`migrations.AlterField(...)`**:  Each `migrations.AlterField` call modifies an existing field in the `transaccion` model.  Let's look at one example in detail:
        *   **`model_name='transaccion'`**: This specifies that the changes are being made to the model named `transaccion`.
        *   **`name='EXP_M'`**: This specifies that the field being altered is named `EXP_M`.
        *   **`field=models.CharField(max_length=2)`**: This defines the new properties of the field. In this case, it's changing the field to a `CharField` (a text field) with a maximum length of 2 characters.
    *   The subsequent `migrations.AlterField` calls do the same thing for other fields: `EXP_Y`, `PAN_1`, `PAN_2`, `PAN_3`, and `PAN_4`. They all change these fields to `CharField` with specific maximum lengths.

**In summary, this Django migration file does the following:**

1.  Specifies a dependency on a previous migration in the `transacciones` app.
2.  Modifies the `transaccion` model by changing the types of several fields (`EXP_M`, `EXP_Y`, `PAN_1`, `PAN_2`, `PAN_3`, `PAN_4`) to `CharField` with a specific `max_length` attribute.  It is likely these fields were previously a different type (e.g., IntegerField, etc.). The migration changes them all to character fields with limited lengths.  The `PAN_` fields likely represent parts of a credit card or account number (PAN = Primary Account Number).

This migration is likely being performed because the developer needs to store these values as strings rather than another data type.  Perhaps they need leading zeros or want to handle non-numeric characters in these fields.
